abstract="We present algorithms for the randomized simulation of a shared memory machine (PRAM) on a Distributed Memory Machine (DMM). In a PRAM, memory conflicts occur only through concurrent access to the same cell, whereas the memory of a DMM is divided into modules, one for each processor, and concurrent accesses to the same module create a conflict. Thedelay of a simulation is the time needed to simulate a parallel memory access of the PRAM. Any general simulation of anm processor PRAM on ann processor DMM will necessarily have delay at leastm/n. A randomized simulation is calledtime-processor optimal if the delay isO(m/n) with high probability. Using a novel simulation scheme based on hashing we obtain a time-processor optimal simulation with delayO(log log(n) log*(n)). The best previous simulations use a simpler scheme based on hashing and have much larger delay: $\Theta$ (log(n)/log log(n)) for the simulation of an n processor PRAM on ann processor DMM, and $\Theta$(log(n)) in the case where the simulation is time-processor optimal.",
