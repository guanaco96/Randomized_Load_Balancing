abstract="We present algorithms for the randomized simulation of a shared memory machine (PRAM) on a Distributed Memory Machine (DMM). In a PRAM, memory conflicts occur only through concurrent access to the same cell, whereas the memory of a DMM is divided into modules, one for each processor, and concurrent accesses to the same module create a conflict. Thedelay of a simulation is the time needed to simulate a parallel memory access of the PRAM. Any general simulation of anm processor PRAM on ann processor DMM will necessarily have delay at leastm/n. A randomized simulation is calledtime-processor optimal if the delay isO(m/n) with high probability. Using a novel simulation scheme based on hashing we obtain a time-processor optimal simulation with delayO(log log(n) log*(n)). The best previous simulations use a simpler scheme based on hashing and have much larger delay: $\Theta$ (log(n)/log log(n)) for the simulation of an n processor PRAM on ann processor DMM, and $\Theta$(log(n)) in the case where the simulation is time-processor optimal.",

title = "Randomized protocols for low-congestion circuit routing in multistage interconnection networks",
abstract = "In this paper we study randomized algorithms for circuit switching on multistage networks related to the butterfly. We devise algorithms that route messages by constructing circuits (or paths) for the messages with small congestion, dilation, and setup time. Our algorithms are based on the idea of having each message choose a route from two possibilities, a technique that has previously proven successful in simpler load balancing settings. As an application of our techniques, we propose a novel design for a data server.",
